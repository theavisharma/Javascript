        Ways of Including JS 
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are two ways of Including JS -
        1. In Document - We can include JS through the "script tag" in a html Document.
        2. External JS - We can include JS through a External file similar like a CSS file  example - 
           nursing.js file (.js extension is used to include Js files)

           Syntax for Externa JS - 
          <!-- <script src="javascript.js"></script> -->
