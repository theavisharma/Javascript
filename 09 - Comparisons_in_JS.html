    <p>
        Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.
        
        Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.
        
        Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test,
        
        while a single one a = b means an assignment.
        
        Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.
